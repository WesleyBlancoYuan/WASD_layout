List of Keys, Mouse Buttons, and Joystick Controls

Mouse


General




LButton Left mouse button 
RButton Right mouse button 
MButton Middle or wheel mouse button 

Advanced




XButton1 4th mouse button. Typically performs the same function as Browser_Back. 
XButton2 5th mouse button. Typically performs the same function as Browser_Forward. 

Wheel




WheelDown Turn the wheel downward (toward you). 
WheelUp Turn the wheel upward (away from you). 
WheelLeft
WheelRight 
[v1.0.48+]: Scroll to the left or right.

Requires Windows Vista or later. These can be used as hotkeys with some (but not all) mice which have a second wheel or support tilting the wheel to either side. In some cases, software bundled with the mouse must instead be used to control this feature. Regardless of the particular mouse, Send and Click can be used to scroll horizontally in programs which support it.

Due to system behavior, the following keys are identified differently depending on whether NumLock is ON or OFF. If NumLock is OFF but Shift is pressed, the system temporarily releases Shift and acts as though NumLock is ON. 
NumLock ON 
NumLock OFF 
 
 
Numpad0 
NumpadIns 0 / Insert key 
 
Numpad1 
NumpadEnd 1 / End key 
 
Numpad2

NumpadPgDn 3 / Page Down key

Function




F1 - F24 The 12 or more function keys at the top of most keyboards. 

Modifier




LWin Left Windows logo key. Corresponds to the <# hotkey prefix. 
RWin Right Windows logo key. Corresponds to the ># hotkey prefix.
Note: Unlike Control/Alt/Shift, there is no generic/neutral "Win" key because the OS does not support it. However, hotkeys with the # modifier can be triggered by either Win key. 
Control (or Ctrl) Control key. As a hotkey (Control::) it fires upon release unless it has the tilde prefix. Corresponds to the ^ hotkey prefix. 
Alt Alt key. As a hotkey (Alt::) it fires upon release unless it has the tilde prefix. Corresponds to the ! hotkey prefix. 
Shift Shift key. As a hotkey (Shift::) it fires upon release unless it has the tilde prefix. Corresponds to the + hotkey prefix. 
LControl (or LCtrl) Left Control key. Corresponds to the <^ hotkey prefix. 
RControl (or RCtrl) Right Control key. Corresponds to the >^ hotkey prefix. 
LShift Left Shift key. Corresponds to the <+ hotkey prefix. 
RShift Right Shift key. Corresponds to the >+ hotkey prefix. 
LAlt Left Alt key. Corresponds to the <! hotkey prefix. 
RAlt Right Alt key. Corresponds to the >! hotkey prefix.
Note: If your keyboard layout has AltGr instead of RAlt, you can probably use it as a hotkey prefix via <^>! as described here. In addition, LControl & RAlt:: would make AltGr itself into a hotkey.

Special




AppsKey Menu key. This is the key that invokes the right-click context menu. 
PrintScreen Print screen 
CtrlBreak 
 
Pause Pause key 
Break Break key. Since this is synonymous with Pause, use ^CtrlBreak in hotkeys instead of ^Pause or ^Break. 
Help Help key. This probably doesn't exist on most keyboards. It's usually not the same as F1. 
Sleep Sleep key. Note that the sleep key on some keyboards might not work with this. 
SCnnn Specify for nnn the scan code of a key. Recognizes unusual keys not mentioned above. See Special Keys for details. 
VKnn Specify for nn the hexadecimal virtual key code of a key. This rarely-used method also prevents certain types of hotkeys from requiring the keyboard hook. For example, the following hotkey does not use the keyboard hook, but as a side-effect it is triggered by pressing either Home or NumpadHome: ^VK24::MsgBox You pressed Home or NumpadHome while holding down Control.

Known limitation: VK hotkeys that are forced to use the keyboard hook, such as *VK24 or ~VK24, will fire for only one of the keys, not both (e.g. NumpadHome but not Home). For more information about the VKnn method, see Special Keys.
